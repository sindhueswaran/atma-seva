      Currently Atma Seva assists Below Poverty Level Families and Widows, many with children, who receive no other support due to illiteracy or geographical distances. We provide monthly stipends for room rent, rations, stove & cooking gas, bedding, clothes, educational fees, school uniforms, books and full medical care according to individual needs assessed by us on a case by case basis.

      During cold winter months we aim to give as many blankets as possible to the homeless and elderly who sleep outside on the streets. We favour night time distributions which enables us to see who is in the most need.
